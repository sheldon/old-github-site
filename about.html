<h1>Sheldon Els</h1>
<p>I was born in Johannesburg and raised across South Africa (Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban). I studied computer science and maths at <a href="http://ru.ac.za">Rhodes University</a> and the <a href="http://uj.ac.za">University of Johannesburg</a>. I left the sunny skies of home to move to the UK in 2007, where I now live in Birmingham.</p>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>Most of the stuff I actively develop in my free time can be found on my <a href="http://github.com/sheldon">github account</a>. I work for <a href="http://oneblackbear.com">One Black Bear</a> making websites and applications. I enjoy working on animation code, the challenge of making computer generated motion look natural.</p>
